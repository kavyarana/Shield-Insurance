# Shield-Insurance - Data Analytics Project
This project is part of the Data Analytics Virtual Internship organized by Codebasics, in collaboration with AtliQ Technologies.

# Project Overview
The primary objective of this project was to analyze and interpret operational data for Shield Insurance, a fictional insurance company. The analysis was aimed at uncovering insights into customer demographics, revenue growth patterns, and sales channel effectiveness to empower Shield Insurance in making data-driven decisions. Utilizing tools like Power BI and Excel, I created an interactive dashboard that highlights key metrics and trends crucial for business strategy and growth optimization.

# Key Insights & Observations
- Peak Performance in March:
March 2023 marked the highest performance month, with a significant surge in revenue and customer acquisition rates, indicating seasonal or campaign-driven success.

- Regional Analysis:
Delhi NCR emerged as the top-performing region, generating the highest revenue and hosting the largest customer base. This suggests a strong market presence in this metropolitan area.

- Age Group Impact:
Customers in the 31-40 age group were the most prominent, contributing the highest revenue and making up a substantial portion of the customer base. This highlights the importance of targeting middle-aged demographics in marketing strategies.

- Sales Mode Preference:
The majority of customers were acquired through offline agents, accounting for over half of the customer base and revenue. This reflects a reliance on traditional sales methods despite the presence of digital channels.

- Policy Popularity:
Specific policy IDs like "POL4321HEL" and "POL2005HEL" were particularly successful, with one drawing in over 4,000 customers and the other generating significant revenue, underscoring the popularity of certain policy types.

# Strategic Recommendations

- Analyze March Trends:
A deeper examination of Marchâ€™s performance factors could uncover strategies to replicate this success throughout the year.

- Leverage Delhi NCR's Success:
Apply successful approaches from Delhi NCR to other regions, particularly in customer acquisition and retention strategies, to build similar growth in other cities.

- Targeted Campaigns for Key Age Groups:
Develop tailored products and marketing campaigns for the 31-40 age demographic, as they have shown strong engagement and revenue potential.

- Evaluate and Enhance Sales Channels:
While offline agents are effective, exploring ways to strengthen digital sales channels could diversify Shield Insurance's reach and reduce dependence on one mode of sales.
